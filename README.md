# Airbnb_web_scraping
Web scraping of Airnbnb website with BeautifulSoup

The idea is to practice web scraping in real scenarios. In this case, I used Airbnb to get information about NYC listings.

**Note**: If Airbnb makes changes to their HTML code due to improvements or A/B testing, it's posible to have issues running the script. As of 2/10/2021 the code works correctly.
